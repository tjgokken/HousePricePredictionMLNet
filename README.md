This codebase is the companion for the article: [link]. It demonstrates the implementation of machine learning concepts using ML.NET, focusing on building a house price prediction model. The codebase includes:

- **Data Setup**: Loading and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Transforming categorical data and normalizing features.
- **Model Training**:
  - **Gradient Descent and Regularization**: Using the SDCA regression trainer to build a linear regression model.
  - **Decision Tree Model**: Implementing the FastTree algorithm for comparison.
  - **Neural Network**: Running a Python script to handle complex relationships not supported by ML.NET.

This codebase provides a practical example of applying different machine learning algorithms to solve a real-world problem, offering insights into their strengths and limitations.
